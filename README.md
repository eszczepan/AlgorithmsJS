# Algorithms tasks

## [Task 003](./003)

### Task:

You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement a function `likes :: [String] -> String`, which must take in input array, containing the names of people who like an item. For 4 or more names, the number in and 2 others simply increases.

It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

### Example:

```
likes [] -- must be "no one likes this"
likes ["Peter"] -- must be "Peter likes this"
likes ["Jacob", "Alex"] -- must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
likes ["Max", "John", "Mark"] -- must be "Max, John and Mark like this"
likes ["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"] -- must be "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
```

## [Task 002](./002)

### Task:

Write a function that given an intiger N, returns the number of times digit 1 occurs in decimal representations of all positive integers not exceeding N. N is an integer within the range [0...100,000]

### Example:

Given N = 13 the function should return 6, because:

- all the positive integers do not exceed 13 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13;
- digit 1 occurs six times altogether: once in number 1, once in number 10, twice in number 11, once in number 12 and once in number 13.

## [Task 001](./001)

### Task:

Write a function that receives two sequences: A and B of integers and returns one sequence C. Sequence C should contain all elements from sequence A (maintaining the order) except those, that are present in sequence B <i>p</i> times, where <i>p</i> is a prime number.

### Example:

A = [2, 3, 9, 2, 5, 1, 3, 7, 10]  
B = [2, 1, 3, 4, 3, 10, 6, 6, 1, 7, 10, 10, 10]  
C = [2, 9, 2, 5, 7, 10]

## [FizzBuzz](./FizzBuzz)

### Task:

The goal of this function is to print out all numbers from 1 to 100 but with three exceptions:

1. For every number that is divisible by 3 and 5, console log "FizzBuzz".
2. For every number that is divisible by only 3 and not 5, console log "Fizz".
3. For every number that is divisible by only 5 and not 3, console .log "Buzz".

### Example:

```
...
"Fizz"
13
14
"FizzBuzz"
16
17
"Fizz"
19
"Buzz"
...
```
